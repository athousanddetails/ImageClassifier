# Image Classifier Algorithm

This project was all about exploring using Tensorflow / Keras for a deep learning algorithm to identify pictures of cats and dogs. 
It's a very well known exercise, and quite fun to work. In the end I was able to have it identifying pictures with good accuracy, even with just one pass of training, since I was using my codespace to train the model. 

With 10 passes, the acurracy would be even bigger, near the 100%, but since resources are expensive, and for time sake, I only did 1 training pass.

## ðŸ“’ Key Takes

Deep Learning is fun and challenging, especially that you need to make sure the machine understands what it needs to learn. The biggest challenge here is resources, as you need a lot of power and especially graphic cards to make it run fast. This project for a prepared server is light, but on a normal machine or a virtual machine like CodeSpaces, it's very hard and time consuming, to the point it breaks kernel. 

But again, Keras / Tensorflow is a wonderful universe, and this is one of the result I've got:
